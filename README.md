# Socket.IO Chat App

Basic chat application with Socket.IO (official library app example)

Source: [Get Started | Socket.IO](https://socket.io/get-started/chat)

My changes:

- use ES6+ syntax
- split client code into separate files for HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- improve serving client side from server
